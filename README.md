# Rubber Stamp

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that will approve pull requests.

Rubber Stamp can be used for the following use cases:

* If your pull requests require an approval, this app can automatically approve them.
* If no other team members are available to approve your PR, Rubber Stamp can approve it so you can get your PR merged.
* If you have an automated process to merge PRs, Rubber Stamp can automatically approve them.

Rubber Stamp requires a label to be added to the pull request. By default the label can be 'Rubber Stamp' or 'rubberstamp'.
You can also configure your own labels for Rubber Stamp to watch. The labels are not case sensitive.

```yml
labels:
  - Rubber Stamp
  - rubberstamp
```
